# Utilitech MPL1004-LED10K840 leg mount

This is a replacement part for a Utilitech LED work light. A few bad falls in the garage will shatter your mounts, which you can replace by printing this part. The cutout on the bottom is for an M6 nut.

I recommend printing this at 100% infill with ABS for maximum durability.
